# AdaptationProtocols

This plugin allows 1.19.60/62 clients to access 1.19.63 servers or 1.19.63 clients to access 1.19.61/62 servers  
The basic game operation test passed, not a lot of testing.
*** 
Note: if not compatible with the probability of non-pairing protocol number of the client crash end.
***
> Plugin principle: cheat the server, modify the client protocol number to achieve the purpose of entry, the method is only for similar to 1.19.20->1.19.21 and other mj for a market bug strong change in the operation of the protocol number (for mappings, packet two protocol versions have not changed)
